excerpt: It's been a pretty busy month by all accounts. The school holidays arrived along with Easter and ANZAC Day, not to me   ntion the run-up to election day here in Australia. Autumn is also in full swing, though warmer than usual. I'm not sure whether I prefer it or not. Still, fewer days using the heating means a cheaper bill so on that front I certainly won't be complaining; doubly so as I'm ever closer to owning my own place.

It's been a pretty busy month by all accounts. The school holidays arrived along with Easter and ANZAC Day, not to mention the run-up to election day here in Australia. Autumn is also in full swing, though warmer than usual. I'm not sure whether I prefer it or not. Still, fewer days using the heating means a cheaper bill so on that front I certainly won't be complaining; doubly so as I'm ever closer to owning my own place.

Things aren't finalised there, yet, but I'm fairly confident that things will progress relatively smoothly. The most exciting part is that it has three bedrooms which means the girls will have a room of their own! To be fair to them, they've been really good about sharing a room this past year and a bit, however, to be able to give them a room each is a huge boon, especially as they get older. The location is good and we're close to a lot of ameneties so, all-in-all, I'm really happy with where we'll hopefully end up living.

My football (soccer) season is in full swing. We're still undefeated, though, two of the three results have been draws. It's nice to be back playing though my fitness really could do with improving more. I'm happy I'm able to keep up a bit better this season but there's still heaps of room for improvement. The girls have come to every game so far, except for yesterday's, as my eldest wanted to be in charge of packing her own stuff rater than letting mum do it. It's lovely to have them on the sideline and I do hope they enjoy watching.

The holidays were pretty understated. Lots of Minecraft was played and I'm learning more and more about how to play the game and what I should and shouldn't be crafting. I've lost countless good gear in the Nether but then, I guess, that's part and parcel of taking a risk and adventuring there. I'm hoping to be more successfull in the future as I'm told we need netherwart and the last batch I lost so I have a debt to pay there it seems.

Otherwise, it's been pretty quiet. I saw Sinners last night as well, good movie, gave me From Dusk Till Dawn vibes and whilst horror isn't usually my jam I really did enjoy it. Andor is back so I'll be watching the new episodes soon and I'm slowly making my way through Columbo. Hope everyone had a lovely Easter and that April has been good to you.

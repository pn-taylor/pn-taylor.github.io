Well, can't say I'm not true to form in barely posting but hey, at least I don't do this for a living. What I have been able to attempt is pointing my domain www.pntaylor.net here instead of the WordPress blog that was there. Whilst it would be handy to run this on the server I have there, it's on a pretty low tier in terms of their plans and given I'm unlikely to be a heavy user, leveraging what I have here on github seemed to make sense.

Hopefully, once the DNS records are fully propagated I can then secure this with HTTPS but, one step at a time.

Here's to building my first project page for something that, in all likelihood, will take some time to come to fruition. Anyway, a bit of backstory may help here.

Last year for my birthday I bought myself an [MPK Mini MK3](https://www.akaipro.com/mpk-mini-mk3) midi keyboard. I'd been mulling over what to do as a hobby outside of gaming to unwind with and occupy the mind. Some would say I should probably have picked something that didn't involve a computer screen but hey-ho. I've had it over a year now and I've barely used it mostly, I think, because I'm just not sure how to start. As such, its sat, on my desk shelves, occasionally brought out when I wanted to just mess around but with no focus.

### So Why LoFi?

I discovered LoFi as a genre thanks, mostly, to ads I was seeing everywhere about music to listen to when studying that featured lots of music from the label [Lowfi Girl](https://www.youtube.com/@LofiGirl). I really liked listening to it, often when writing game reviews and felt it was something I could try my hand at. That's not to say there's anything easy about it but a lot of tracks tend to be short loops and it was somewhere to start

### Something - Nov 2022

So here we are, November 2022 and I've got thirteen seconds worth of something. It's not much, I'm not massively happy with it but it's something. I'm hoping to tweak this a touch and then build other parts of the intended song and then build it up in parts. One thing I've learned is that you can map sequences to the pads so that way you can build individual parts of a song and build it from hitting the pad you want. I'll continue to update this project page as things progress, maybe even some thoughts on how it's going and so on.

In any event, it may make me somewhat accountable, at least, that's the idea.
